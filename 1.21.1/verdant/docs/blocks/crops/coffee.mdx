# Obtaining

Like the other crops in this mod, **Coffee** is harvested from a wild variant. However, it's harvested slightly differently. To gain **Coffee Berries**, which can be planted to grow coffee as a crop, players should use bone-meal **Wild Coffee** bushes repeatedly. Eventually, the **Wild Coffee** will drop a **Coffee Berry**. **Wild Coffee** bushes can also be used as decoration, like any other flower.

# Growing Coffee 

**Coffee** is grown and harvested almost identically to **Sweet Berries**. The only difference is that it can only be grown on hoed **Farmland**, like most other crops.

# Uses

**Coffee Berries** can be eaten for a quick burst of **Speed**, but are not a very fitting food. They can be smelted into **Roasted Coffee**, which grants a similar burst of **Haste**.

# Brewing

As expected, **Roasted Coffee** can be brewed to produce **Coffee** bottles. These grant the **Caffeinated** effect.

- **Roasted Coffee** is brewed into **Water Bottles** to produce **Coffee**. 

- **Sugar** is brewed into **Coffee** to produce **Sweet Coffee**, which has a stronger effect.

- **Roasted Coffee** is brewed into **Coffee** to produce **Strong Coffee**, which grants a longer-lasting effect.

- **Sugar** is brewed into **Strong Coffee** to produce **Sweet Strong Coffee**, which has a strong effect over a long duration.

- **Roasted Coffee** is brewed into **Sweet Coffee** to produce **Sweet Strong Coffee** as well, providing a second recipe with the same cost.

What does the **Caffeinated** effect do? While **Caffeinated**, entities will receive a significant boost to their movement and mining speed; however, this comes at a cost. When the effect wears off, the entity will be left with **Slowness** and **Mining Fatigue** for a duration that depends on the strength of the effect!
