# Obtaining

Among the many hazards of the **Verdant Growth**, intrepid explorers will sometimes find odd plants with large leaves. 

<Asset width={128} height={128} location="verdant:item/wild_cassava" title="Wild Cassava" />

Breaking these will sometimes yield **Bitter Cassava Cuttings** the seed-analogue of *Bitter Cassava**. You can plant these like any other seeds. Keep in mind that **Cassava** is a two-block-tall crop. **Wild Cassava** can also be harvested with shears or silk touch, to be used as decoration or put in a flower pot.

# Growing Cassava 

Since **Cassava** is a two-block-tall crop, it takes somewhat longer to grow than a crop like wheat or carrots. To make up for this, it produces significantly more resources than its shorter alternatives. Cassava's unique life cycle has an additional twist; when it is fully mature, its roots will grow - not as part of the plant - but instead into the farmland it was placed on, converting the farmland into **Cassava Rooted Dirt**. Breaking the plant itself will drop a large number of its respective **Cuttings**, but no food. To harvest the roots, use a hoe on the **Cassava Rooted Dirt** to pop the **Cassava** roots out of it.

# Bitter Cassava 

Perceptive players will notice that the **Cassava** products mentioned so far have been **Bitter Cassava**. Taking inspiration from its real-life properties, **Cassava** in this mod comes in two variants. Products made from uncooked **Bitter Cassava** will inflict a slow and cumulative poison on the player; eating a small amount of it mixed in with a varied diet will avert the worst effects, but subsiding purely on **Bitter Cassava** will prove harmful. 

How, then, is normal **Cassava** obtained? **Bitter Cassava** plants will rarely drop **Cassava Cuttings**, which will grow into a near-identical plant whose roots lack the toxic compounds found in **Bitter Cassava**. These can be eaten safely to no ill effect. Non-bitter **Cassava** is less hardy, however, and produces less food per crop.

# Uses

What is **Cassava** used for? Non-bitter **Cassava** can be cooked into **Baked Cassava**, a food with properties similar to **Steak**. It is an excellent and filling food. Alternatively, both types of **Cassava** can be crafted into, respectively, **Starch** and **Bitter Starch**. One **Cassava** crafts into four **Starch**. **Starch** is currently only used to make **Bread**. **Bitter Starch** produces **Bitter Bread**, which will inflict cumulative **Cassava Poisoning** when consumed in large amounts. **Cassava** and **Starch** can be fed to many animals in some form or another.

# Golden Cassava 

**Cassava** can be crafted with eight **Gold Ingots** to create a **Golden Cassava**. This powerful item has two uses. It can be cooked into a **Baked Golden Cassava**; this grants both **Absorption** and **Resistance** when consumed. Alternatively, it can be crafted into **Sparkling Starch**. **Sparkling Starch** can be used in potion-making (see below) or crafted into **Golden Bread**, which grants a higher level of **Absorption** but no other effect.

# Brewing

**Sparkling Starch** can be brewed in a potion stand into a **Thick Potion** to produce a **Potion of Colloid**; entities inflicted with this effect will be briefly slowed when they take damage. This can be very useful against faster or more evasive foes.
