# Obtaining

Amidst the many hazards of the **Verdant Growth**, explorers may find odd plants with large leaves.

Breaking these yields **Bitter Cassava Cuttings**, the seed equivalent of **Bitter Cassava**. These can be planted like other crops. Since **Cassava** crops grow two blocks tall, ensure enough space. **Wild Cassava** can also be harvested with shears or silk touch for decoration or planting in flower pots.

# Growing Cassava

**Cassava** takes longer to grow than wheat or carrots but yields significantly more resources. Upon reaching full maturity, its roots extend into the farmland, converting it into **Cassava Rooted Dirt**. Harvesting the plant itself drops many **Cuttings**, but no food. To obtain **Cassava** roots, use a hoe on **Cassava Rooted Dirt**.

# Bitter Cassava

**Cassava** exists in two variants. By default, crops yield **Bitter Cassava**, which contains toxic compounds. Consuming too much causes a slow, cumulative poison effect. However, eating small amounts within a varied diet mitigates the risk.

Rarely, **Bitter Cassava** plants drop **Cassava Cuttings**, which grow into a non-toxic variant. This **Cassava** is safe to eat but produces less food and is less hardy.

<Callout variant="danger">
    **Cassava Poisoning** is cumulative - it may not have much of an effect initially, but will intensify and last longer as more **Bitter Cassava** foods are eaten.
</Callout>

# Uses

Non-bitter **Cassava** can be cooked into **Cooked Cassava**, a filling food similar to **Steak**. Both **Cassava** variants can be processed into **Starch** and **Bitter Starch** (one **Cassava** yields four **Starch**). **Starch** is primarily used for crafting **Bread**, while **Bitter Starch** creates **Bitter Bread**, which causes **Cassava Poisoning** if eaten in excess. Cassava-based items can also be fed to various animals.

# Golden Cassava

**Cassava** can be combined with eight **Gold Ingots** to create **Golden Cassava**, which has two powerful uses. **Cooked Golden Cassava** grants **Absorption** and **Resistance** when eaten. **Sparkling Starch**, crafted from **Golden Cassava**, can be used for potion-making or crafted into **Golden Bread**, which provides stronger **Absorption**.

# Brewing

**Sparkling Starch** can be brewed into a **Potion of Colloid** using a potion stand. This potion slows entities briefly upon taking damage, making it a useful tool against fast or evasive foesâ€”especially when combined with environmental hazards like spikes.
