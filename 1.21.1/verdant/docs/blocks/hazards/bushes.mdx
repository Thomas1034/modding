# Tangled Bushes

One of the most common hazards of the **Verdant Growth** is the **Tangled Bush**. This plant comes in two variations. Ordinary **Tangled Bushes** do not deal damage to entities that walk through them; they simply slow them, similarly to cobwebs. **Thorny Tangled Bushes**, on the other hand, will damage entities that move inside them! Landing on **Thorny Tangled Bushes** is even more painful.

<Callout variant="info">
		Entities considered friendly by the **Verdant Growth** can move through **Tangled Bushes** without being slowed or harmed.
</Callout>


**Tangled Bushes** are broken fastest with a hoe. When broken, **Thorny Tangled Bushes** will drop **Thorns**. Ordinary **Tangled Bushes** will drop sticks.
