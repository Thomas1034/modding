# Tangled Bushes

One of the most common hazards of the **Verdant Growth** is the **Tangled Bush**. This plant comes in two variations. Ordinary **Tangled Bushes** do not deal damage to entities that walk through them; they simply slow them, similarly to cobwebs. **Thorny Tangled Bushes**, on the other hand, will damage entities that move inside them! Landing on **Thorny Tangled Bushes** is even more painful. **Tangled Bushes** can be harvested with Silk Touch or shears and planted in flower pots for decoration. They will not damage entities when inside flower pots.

<Callout variant="info">
		Entities considered friendly by the **Verdant Growth** can move through **Tangled Bushes** without being slowed or harmed.
</Callout>

**Tangled Bushes** are broken fastest with a hoe. When broken, **Thorny Tangled Bushes** will drop **Thorns**. Ordinary **Tangled Bushes** will drop **Sticks**. Since Tangled Bushes regrow quickly, they are a good source of **Thorns**.
