# Verdant Conduit

The **Verdant Conduit** is a powerful block found inside some **Overgrown Pyramids**. When it is activated, it will rapidly spread the **Verdant Growth** to nearby blocks, while boosting nearby crop growth. Additionally, it will grant players the **Verdant Energy** effect within a radius, making them immune to the many hazards of the **Verdant Growth**.


A **Verdant Conduit** can be crafted out of a **Heart of the Forest** and eight logs of any type. It's activated analogously to the vanilla **Conduit**; however, instead of requiring a frame made of **Prismarine**, it requires a frame built of **logs** of any type.

    You can use any log for crafting the **Verdant Conduit**; oak logs are used here as an example.

A good strategy for players who have obtained several **Hearts of the Forest** is to place **Verdant Conduits** in strategic areas of their bases; this will give them zones of immunity to the deleterious effects of the many harmful plants.
