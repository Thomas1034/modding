# The Verdant Growth  

The **Verdant Growth** is an unstoppable plant infection that spreads across the world, consuming forests and reshaping landscapes. It expands through two primary mechanisms: strangler vines entwine and overgrow trees, and underground roots transform even deepslate into lush greenery. This relentless overgrowth introduces new resources, challenges, and dangers; survival can be difficult, but the rewards are well worth it. Players who unleash the Verdant Growth must be prepared—it cannot be contained easily.  

Overgrown regions offer unique materials and ingredients. Strangler-vine-covered trees yield large amounts of **Strangler Wood**, while the rarer **Heartwood** can be crafted into tools, weapons, and armor. Players may rarely find **Imbued Heartwood**, a key step in creating rapidly self-repairing equipment.  

Many other plants have distinct and useful properties: **Poison Ivy** can be crafted into **Poison Arrows**, **Thorn Bushes** provide materials for devious traps, and climbable **Strangler Tendrils** can be crafted into **Rope** and upgradable throwable **Rope Coils**. Many plants serve as ingredients for powerful potions, while crops like **cassava**, **ube**, and **coffee** introduce unique mechanics, risks, and rewards.

Fortunately, the Verdant Growth doesn’t spread naturally. Players must first locate an **Overgrown Pyramid** hidden in jungle biomes and deliberately trigger its release. Once it is set loose, all players in the world will receive an advancement notification—marking the start of a slow spread that will consume and transform the world.
