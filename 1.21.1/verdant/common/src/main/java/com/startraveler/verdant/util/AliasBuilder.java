/**
 * Alias Method for Weighted Random Selection
 * <p>
 * This class implements the Alias Method, which efficiently selects an item
 * from a set based on weighted probabilities. The Alias Method allows for
 * constant time selection (O(1)) after an initial preprocessing step (O(n)),
 * making it ideal for scenarios with repeated weighted random selections.
 * <p>
 * The method preprocesses the weights into two tables:
 * 1. A probability table containing normalized probabilities for each item.
 * 2. An alias table, which maps items with probabilities greater than 1 to
 * an alias, ensuring the selection process remains efficient.
 * <p>
 * After preprocessing, selecting an item based on its weight is done in O(1) time.
