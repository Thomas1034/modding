 Thomas's Minecraft Modding

 Current project: [Cloudscape](https://github.com/Thomas1034/modding/tree/main/1.20.1/examplemod)
 
 I neglected to change the directory name from "examplemod" when creating the project, and my development environment now refuses to let me change it now.

 The project [QuantumCircuit](https://github.com/Thomas1034/modding/tree/main/1.20.1/quantumcircuit) will be worked on when I have reached a sufficient degree of skill. Currently, it does nothing. Eventually, it will allow simulating block-built quantum circuits in Minecraft that are capable of integrating with existing redstone constructions. It is primarily intended as a technology demonstration and a learning aid, as I cannot think of very many uses for quantum circuits. QuantumCircuit makes use of the [squire](https://github.com/Thomas1034/squire) library, which allows for simulating quantum circuits in Java and was originally created to assist with this project.
